Project used for learning basics of AngularJS

By Patrick Stalcup

##Goals
* To use AngularJS to build something meaningful
* To remember git (at least for personal projects)
* To be creative and design something for games

##Run
* Check out the project
* Ensure that you have `node` and `npm` installed
* On the command line in the directory you checked out, type `npm install`
* Then type `gulp serve`. If this fails, type `npm install -g gulp`, which needs admin privledges. Then retry `gulp serve`
* The app should then pop up in the browser
